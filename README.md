### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Daniel Valadas, I am a freelance software developer since I was in my teens but have been doing this full time since 2004. I am based in Canada a bit north of Montreal (Ste-Agathe-des-Monts). I am most proficient in the Microsoft stack including C# and TypeScript. I like standards and vanilla code with minimal dependencies.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on DNN (Formerly DotNetNuke). DNN has been my bread and butter for many years. I love the Platform and most of my open source contributions are centered around it.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to do testing right (unit tests and integration tests) as I feel this is the right way to do software.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any DNN related projects. I love co-coding. If you feel like working on a issue but need help, ping me up and I'll be glad to help or simply split the work.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with contributions. Open Source is very important and it is often very time consuming free work by a handful of contributors. I would like for those involved frequently into Open Souce contributions to get some financial help from those who need the fixes/features but are not coders. It would help move projects forward much faster. If you like my Open Source work and want to contribute here is my [sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/valadas). Also if you would like to sponsor any specific feature, feel free to reach out, I'll be glad to discuss it.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to DNN, I have lots of experience with it and also know many of the community members and can always reach to some friend.
